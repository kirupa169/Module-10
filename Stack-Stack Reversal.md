# # Stack-Stack Reversal Program 🔁

This Python program demonstrates how to reverse the values in a stack using basic stack operations like push and pop.

## 🎯 Aim

To write a Python program that reverses the values in a stack using standard stack operations.

## 📋 Algorithm

1. Create an empty stack.
2. Read an integer `n` from the user (number of elements to push).
3. Loop `n` times:
   - Read an integer from the user.
   - Push it onto the stack.
4. Create an empty list called `reverse`.
5. While the stack is not empty:
   - Pop the top element.
   - Append it to `reverse`.
6. Print the reversed list.


### Program:
```
stack = []
n=int(input())
for i in range(n):
value=int(input())
stack.append(value)
reverse= []
while stack:
reverse.append(stack.pop())
print(reverse)
```
